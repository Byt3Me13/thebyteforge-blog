## Welcome to The ByteForge

<br>

I’m a Cybersecurity Researcher and Incident Responder with a deep focus on digital forensics, malware analysis, and incident response. My career began in the trenches as a SOC Analyst, where I cut my teeth investigating threats in real time. Over the years, I’ve grown into a seasoned responder, working high-impact cases such as SolarWinds, Hafnium, and Log4j. These experiences didn’t just sharpen my technical skills, they solidified my mission: protecting others from the very threats I once chased down in the wild. 

I currently hold multiple GIAC certifications, including the **GCIH**, **GCFA**, and **GREM**, which validate my expertise in under

But the path that led me here wasn't a straight one. 

Like many in this field, my curiousity started young and not a mistake fueled it. One of my first earliest lessons came when I downloaded sketchy software in hopes of playing a game for free. Instead, I got a front-row seat as a virus infected my computer in real time. I watched in horror and fascination. That moment lit a spark. I didn't just want to *fix* the problem, I wanted to full understand how it worked and how I could fight back. 

Years later, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, diving deep into networking, systems, and security. I started building out virtual machines (VMs), experimenting with tools, and learning them on the fly. That hands-on, self-driven mindset never left me. It's what shaped this blog, and it's what fuels my work today! 

Along with a whole lot of coffee.

# The Lab Behind the Forge

What began as a collection of isolated VMs has grown into a full-fledged, simulated enterprise environment, complete with Windows Servers, workstations, domain controllers, a segmented network, and a dedicated malware analysis zone. This custom lab is my forge: the place where I test real-world malware, simulate breaches, reverse engineer threats, and craft detections. 

Through this blog, I aim to:
- Share **actionable research** and **technical write-ups**.
- Provide **tools**, **detection rules**, and **indicators**.
- Support the community through **transparent knowledge sharing**.
- Make advanced topics more **accessible** and **understandable**.

Whether you’re a seasoned analyst, a researcher building your own forge, or simply a curious newcomer, welcome. This is your place too. This is where we forge stronger defenses.

# Still Learning, Still Forging

This site is a growing project, just like me. I'm still learning, still exploring, and still chasing the spark that started it all. My goal isn't just to document my findings. They're opportunities for others to find their way. I know what it's like to feel overwhelmed, to think *"I'll never get this."*

But here's the thing: learning in cybersecurity feels like climbing a mountain. At the base, the summit looks impossible. Every step is hard, every rock seems to block the way. But if you keep going, step by step, the view opens up. One day, you'll look back and realize just how far you've come. 

We all start at the bottom. You’ll get there too. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll climb higher than I have. That’s the **FIRE** that lights this Forge.

All content I share here comes from my own research, conducted in a fully isolated lab I built from the ground up. This work is entirely independent and represents only my personal efforts and perspectives. This isn't just my work. It's my craft, my forge, and my fire.

*This is my forge.*

*This is my fire.*
